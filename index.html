      <h1>Gurinayat Mangat</h1>
      <p>I’m a computer science student interested in how data and systems shape how we see the world. I’m especially drawn to questions around place, public information, and how technical tools are used in real contexts.</p>

        <p>I enjoy working alongside other students and early-stage collaborators, especially in spaces where learning together matters more than polish or speed. I value clear communication, shared credit, and being honest about what I don’t yet know.</p>
        <button onclick="document.location='collaborate.html'">Collaborate with me</button>
        <p>I keep a Binder of Thoughts on this site as a way to think in public : notes, reflections, and ideas in progress. It’s not meant to be definitive, just a record of how my thinking evolves over time.</p>
        <button onclick="document.location='binder.html'">View Binder</button>
        <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning, building, and working on projects that feel thoughtful and grounded. If something here resonates with you, feel free to reach out.</p>
